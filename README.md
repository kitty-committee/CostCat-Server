# CostCat-Server

Welcome to my untested nightmares!

At the time of writing, it is 1:53am on February 13th, 2026. I have written this entire program
(up to [this commit](https://github.com/kitty-committee/CostCat-Server/commit/7c717750c63808cdd8eeb3388d2074dcca52c525))
since I got home from University at about 9pm.

Needless to say, I can barely keep my eyes open at this point, and I have not tested a _single_ part of this code.
Just wrote, and kept writing.

In any case, this is meant to replace my existing [CostCat](https://github.com/Nathcat/CostCat) application,
working as the back end API to the front end PWA which is being created by my good friend [Brooke](https://github.com/brooke-ec).

It implements all the existing functionality of CostCat, and in addition, allows for transactions to be given
descriptions, and exposes and endpoint for editing a transaction after it has been created.
